# ResearchConnect
Welcome to the official GitHub repository of **ResearchConnect** for **WildlifeNL**. ResearchConnect serves as a research portal designed to facilitate the creation and management of experiments. In these experiments, researchers can create questionnaires and messages that will be sent when certain conditions are met to collect data for their research. The collected data from these experiments can also be exported in CSV format for further analysis. For more detailed instructions, please refer to the [Docs](./Docs) folder.
